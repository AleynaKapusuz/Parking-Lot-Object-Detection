🚗 Parking Lot Object Detection with YOLOv8


In this project, I used the Ultralytics YOLOv8 model to successfully detect occupied parking spaces and available spots within a parking lot scene.


📌 Project Highlights:
Object classes: car (occupied) and free (available)
Detected objects are visualized with bounding boxes:
🟪 Purple: Available parking spot
🟩 Green: Occupied parking spot

Low-confidence detections are filtered using a custom threshold


⚙️ Technologies Used:
 Python, OpenCV, Ultralytics, YOLOv8

 
💡 This project is designed for parking automation and urban system integration.
